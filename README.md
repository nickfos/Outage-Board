# Outage-Board
A very poorly written-and-littered-with-exposition bottom of the barrel outage board in C#/HTML/CSS/Javascript.
Worked out roughly how to put this together as a POC a few (maybe 7?) years ago, kind of for my own personal use/interest.

## Installation
1) Push the solution to an IIS server somehow - [here's one way ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/deploying-to-iis)

2) Manually create an empty file called *data.csv* in *`C:\inetpub\wwwroot\`*

3) Restart the site in IIS
